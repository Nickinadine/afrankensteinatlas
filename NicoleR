<b<p>Though Mary Shelley's personal life rarely reflected the deeply traditional and religiously, socially, and politically accepted patriarchal norms of 19th century England, her novel <em>Frankenstein</em> initially appears to reinforce this predetermined demarcation between genders.  The customary hierarchy within social circles and the family unit are clearly and distinctly represented and class and contrast are magnified by each character.  Specifically, almost every female character is developed and presented as a lovely "saint" who knows her place and duty within the home, placing all other's well-being and care above her own.  This is plainly exhibited in the central characterizations of Elizabeth, who though she longs for the freedoms exercised by men, she is resigned to her position as caretaker, longing for marriage to Victor, as he finds her resignation "enchanting".  Justine, who is executed for one of the Monster's murders, goes to her death with all the genteel humbleness Shelley could muster. Her innocence and purity are all the more illuminated as she bravely and without malice takes the punishment for another. Even Victor's mother, Caroline, is cast as a paragon of virtue and kindness, especially during the time of her own death, as she endeavors to assuage the pain of her loved-ones, wanting to pass calming to that her dying is not a burden to anyone.  
On the other side of this patriarchal coin is the main protagonist, Victor Frankenstein. Intelligent and ambitious, he envelops the very attributes that make him a good male during this era. And yet, as the story progresses, Victor's reactions to the consequences of his decision to create and then abandon the Monster swiftly digress from responsibility to hysteria. He spends much of the book sick in bed, bemoaning the state of his life. Hysteria has historically been recorded as a female plight. And yet, Mary Shelly thrusts this condition upon her main male character, instead of any of her female ones. They all suffer greatly in some capacity in this book, all stemming from Frankenstein's one fatal error. Perhaps for this very reason, as he is the root of the problem, his reaction is all the more intense. Yet it still appears incongruous with the time. This essay will focus on how the female characters, while staying in their patriarchal, designated position, are unable to sway the events surrounding them. And while Victor emerges out of his gender-assigned emotional repression, he too is powerless to affect change as he see fits. The roles of reason and hysteria are switched in this novel and what does that swap say about Shelley and her interpretation of this era.</p>>
